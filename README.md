# Coffee Shop
A code assessment/technical interview question from a recent Front End job interview

1. Given a list of different coffees with assigned 'minutes' (seconds), create a Menu
2. When a Menu Item is clicked, it's added to the barista's Orders queue
3. The Barista can only make a single drink at a time
4. When the Barista is finished making the drink, it is placed on the Counter
5. Drinks placed on the Counter are picked up within 3 seconds

ToDo:
1. How do we fix Counter state logic to remove an item 3 seconds after the point it was added? Currently, 1 item is removed from top every 3 seconds.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
